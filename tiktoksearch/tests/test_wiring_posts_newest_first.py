"""Wiring tests for `/user/posts`' newest-first ordering.

The ordering is a CONTRACT (`UserPostsResponse.results` states it, and
`demo.html` accumulates-and-re-sorts on top of it), and until this file it was
entirely untested — for a reason worth recording, because it is the shape of
hole that repeats: `conftest.videos()` / `authored_videos()` built their
`aweme_info` with no `create_time`, so `mapping._iso_utc` returned None for
every fake, every `_create_time_key` was the unknown-date sentinel, and a
stable sort over all-equal keys is indistinguishable from no sort at all.
Three separate mutations of the sort passed 497/497 green: `reverse=True`
removed (feed comes back OLDEST-first), the `_newest_first` call deleted from
the handler, and `UNKNOWN_CREATE_TIME_KEY` changed from `''` to `'zzzz'`
(undated records lifted to the FRONT — the exact fabrication, "this is the
most recent post", that the sentinel's own docstring says it exists to
prevent). The conftest builders now stamp a `create_time`, which is what makes
everything below able to fail.

Three things shape the assertions:

1. **The string sort key's soundness is pinned as a property of
   `mapping._iso_utc`, not assumed.** `_create_time_key` sorts ISO-8601
   STRINGS rather than parsed datetimes, and that is only correct because
   every rendered timestamp has equal width, zero-padded fields and the same
   `+00:00` offset. So the 25-character form is asserted across the whole
   reachable `datetime` range — negative epochs included — together with
   epoch-order == string-order. A `Z` suffix, or a fractional `ts` reaching
   `_iso_utc`, silently breaks the ordering everywhere, with no error.
2. **A tie group is arranged so the sort MOVES something.** An assertion whose
   pre-sort order already equals the sorted order is the same no-op that
   blinded the 497, so every ordering test here starts from a page that is
   NOT already sorted.
3. **The impostor is arranged as the NEWEST record.** The existing impostor
   test (`test_wiring_profile_posts_api.py`) does not constrain the sort; this
   is the arrangement where ordering decides index 0, on a terminal page so
   `page_token` is null and "absent from the body" means every byte.

Everything is stubbed at `requests.Session.get` and driven through the real
app; `signer: local` keeps the paid-signer ledger at zero. Nothing leaves the
process (conftest's tripwire).

# ============ 6: the out-of-range `create_time` is served as an unknown date
class TestAnOutOfRangeCreateTimeIsServedAsAnUnknownDate:
    """`_iso_utc` degrading is pinned above as a property of the pure
    function. That pin alone is not enough, though: it stays green if the
    degradation never reaches the client, so what the caller actually GETS is
    pinned here, end to end through the real app.

    This class previously pinned the opposite: `_iso_utc` raised `ValueError`
    on an out-of-range `create_time`, nothing between `flatten_video` and the
    ASGI boundary caught it (`pool.run_call` does not, and `_domain_errors`
    maps only the domain classes), and an absurd upstream value escaped the
    handler as a 500 — on `/search` as much as on `/user/posts`. That is now
    fixed in `mapping._iso_utc`, so the assertions below are re-pinned to the
    fixed behaviour: the record is SERVED, with `create_time: null`, and it
    sorts LAST rather than claiming to be the newest post.

    The failure was never an identity one — `transport.calls` is non-empty, so
    TikTok answered fine — which is why it must not surface as a 502 either."""
