        ONE signed request.

        Reuses the EXISTING user-search endpoint rather than adding a lookup
        path, and reads the node straight off that one reply instead of going
        through `_search_users`: that would keep paginating until it had filled
        a `limit`, and every extra page is another signed request and another
        daily-cap unit spent on an answer that is either on the first page or
        not there at all.

        The RAW node is returned rather than a flattened record because its two
        callers want different projections of it — `resolve_user` wants the two
        ids, `profile_from_search` wants the whole flattened profile — and
        flattening here would force one of them to work backwards from the
        other's shape.

        `username` arrives already normalised from the API boundary (no leading
        `@`, bounded length and charset) — validating caller input belongs
        there, not down here.

        The match is an EXACT, case-insensitive `unique_id` comparison. User
        search is FUZZY and happily returns neighbours, so taking the first (or
        the best-scoring) hit would silently serve a different account's
        profile and posts — a wrong answer presented as a right one, which is
        worse than no answer. No exact hit is `NotFound` (404), never a
        SoftError: the caller named a user that is not there and the warm
        identity did nothing wrong.

        MEASURED against live TikTok, not assumed: a nonsense username is
        answered with a POPULATED `user_list`, so a bad username really does
        reach the no-exact-match `NotFound` below and not the
        empty-`user_list` path. `{"query": "definitely-not-a-real-user-999999",
        "type": "user", "limit": 10}` returned HTTP 200 with 10 fuzzy
        neighbours (`notzd9`, `user12342069911`, `user999999l08`,
        `notarealuser9`, `jaco.999`) — not one an exact match, so all of them
        are filtered out by the comparison above.

        An EMPTY `user_list` is a different case and must STAY a `SoftError`
        (502) through SEARCH_PAYLOAD: an empty item list on a sessionless first
        page IS the `hit_shark` signature, and nothing in the payload tells it
        apart from a username that does not exist. Answering 404 there would
        launder a possible shadow-block into a definitive claim about the
        account, and would throw away the identity-health report that is the
        only way the pool learns its warm identity has gone cold.

        A DEDICATED loop rather than `_paginate_into`, because that function is
        search-shaped in three places and two of them are INVERTED here:

        * it reads TikTok's `cursor`; a posts reply answers with `max_cursor`;
        * a search cursor is a forward OFFSET that must strictly INCREASE, so
          `_paginate_into` clamps with `max(cursor, ...)` and stops when the
          cursor fails to advance. A posts `max_cursor` is a millisecond epoch
          walking BACKWARDS through the user's timeline: the clamp would throw
          page 2's older cursor away and the guard would then stop the stream
          at one page;
        * it bounds every cursor by its OWN path's `paging.cursor_bound`,
          which for a search path is 100_000 — a bound a ms-epoch cursor
          exceeds on the very FIRST page, so borrowing the search family's
          value here would retire the endpoint immediately. This loop applies
          the same selector to its own path instead:
          `cursor_bound(USER_POSTS_PATH)` is `paging.MAX_MS_EPOCH_CURSOR`,
          enforced here on the way in and by `encode`/`decode` on both sides
          of a page_token.

        It also hardcodes `shape=SEARCH_PAYLOAD` and echoes `search_id` /
        reads `log_pb.impr_id`, neither of which this endpoint has. Threading
        five more parameters through the function `/search` depends on, in
        order to invert its cursor contract, buys nothing this loop does not
        already give. What DOES generalise is reused unchanged: `_page_budget`
